                Hi, my name is Max Hoecker. <br/>
                I'm sure you've probably seen many sites like these. What makes mine different? Ummmmmm.<br/>
                I made it?<br/>
                Anyway, what are some things about me? Well my top 4 things I like to do are Tennis, Vidya Gaming, Travelling, and just hanging with my friends.<br/>
                I come from a small town in Maine called Boothbay<br/>
                I currently attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a 4th year software engineer.<br/>
                I've been on one co-op, it was this past Summer/Fall of 2020 and I'm currently looking for a co-op for the spring semester<br/>
