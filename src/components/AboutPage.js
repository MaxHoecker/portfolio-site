                    Hi, I'm Max.<br/>
                </h2>

                <br/>
                I'm sure you've probably seen many sites like these. Sorry for it not being the prettiest site you've seen. I tried pretty hard to make it look nice though.<br/>
                <br/>
                Anyway, what are some things about me? Well my top 4 things I like to do are tennis, video gaming, travelling, and just hanging with my friends.<br/>
                I come from a small town in Maine called Boothbay, where my passion for STEM was nurtured by a supportive community.<br/>
                I currently attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a 4th year software engineer.<br/>
                <br/>
                I absolutely love coding and am very excited to be coding full-time when I graduate.<br/>
                And I've been on one co-op, it was this past Summer/Fall of 2020 and I'm currently looking for a co-op for the spring semester.<br/>
