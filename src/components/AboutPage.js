            Hi, my name is Max Hoecker. <br/>
            I'm sure you've probably seen many sites like these. What makes mine different? Ummmmmm.<br/>
            I made it?<br/>
            Anyway, what are some things "About Me"(use the component that looks like the tab)? Well my top 4 things I like to do are Tennis, Vidya Gaming, Travelling, and just hanging with my friends.<br/>
            I come from a small town in Maine called Boothbay<br/>
            I currently attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a 4th year software engineer.<br/>
            I've been on one co-op, it was this past Summer/Fall of 2020 and I'm currently looking for a co-op for the spring semester<br/>
        </p>
