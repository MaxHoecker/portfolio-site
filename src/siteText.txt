Hi, my name is Max Hoecker.
I'm sure you've probably seen many sites like these. What makes mine different? Uhhhhhh
The heart and soul I've poured into it?
Anyway, what are some things "About Me"(use the component that looks like the tab)? Well my top 4 things I like to do are Tennis, Vidya Gaming, Travelling, and just hanging with my friends.
I come from a small town in Maine called Boothbay
I currently attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a 4th year software engineer.
I've been on one co-op, it was this past Summer/Fall of 2020 and I'm currently looking for a co-op for the spring semester

How It's Made:

--prelude
You may be wondering, What is this mysterious tab called "how it's made" and why does it exist?
Basically, I was looking at different places to apply for spring co-ops and in their application they would have a field for "personal website"
so I thought, why haven't I made a site of my own?
I certainly know how to
What should I put on this site?
How about the steps I went through to make it?
And thus my journey begins...

So I know that there's two main pieces I'll need, some code that makes up the site, and a machine for the site to be hosted on.
In terms of having a machine to run the site on I knew I had two main options, hosting it on a cloud instance or on a raspberry pie I have lying around.
I decided to go for making a vm instance on AWS for mostly the learning experience and in-case I want to use my raspberry pi for something else later.

So I made an AWS account, booted up a micro ec2-instance on the free tier, set up sshing into the VM, and allowed http and https protocols in the security groups
Now I need to set up the project that will be the code that actually runs

So I went to my favorite ide for web development(Webstorm), made a new React based project, and linked it up to a remote git repository

When making a site choosing a css framework to use can significantly cut down on development time
I decided to go with Tailwind because it's lightweight and allows a lot of customization very rapidly

After choosing a css framework I now have to do all the grunt work including writing this text you're reading and putting in these images you're looking at

Here's what the site looked like real early on (I sure hope it looks better now)


After some work on the site's looks I wanted to make it so that I could actually run the code I've been writing on the VM I had booted up on AWS
So after connecting to the Virtual Machine I installed git, made a folder for the website to be contained within,
pulled the repository from github, installed nodejs and npm, installed dependencies, and then made a production build of the app

After a bit of pain editing the Virtual Machine's security groups again, and messing with installation commands and config files,
I eventually got it so that the nginx landing page would appear when I went to the VM's public ip address

-buying a domain from namecheap
-linking the domain name to the VM instance
-bada-bing bada-boom the site works!

Shoutout to my friend Rachel for helping me figure out how to make the site not look like trash!
