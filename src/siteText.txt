blah blah blah
so I thought, why not make a site of my own?
What should I put on this site?
How about what I went through to make it?
So I know that there's two main pieces I'll need, some code that makes up the site, and a machine for the site to be hosted on.
In terms of having a machine to run the site on I knew I had two main options, hosting it on a cloud instance or on a raspberry pie I have lying around.
I decided to go for making a vm instance on AWS for mostly the learning experience
So I made an AWS account, booted up a micro ec2-instance on the free tier, set up sshing into the VM, and allowed http and https protocols in the security groups
Now I need to set up the project that will be the code that actually runs
So I went to my favorite ide for web development(Webstorm) and made a new React based project, and linked it up to a remote git repository
When making a site choosing a css framework to use can significantly cut down on development time
I decided to go with (Tailwind?) because it's lightweight and allows a lot of customization
After choosing a css framework I now have to do all the grunt work including writing this text you're reading and putting in these images you're looking at

-css framework chosen
-setting up nginx on the VM
-pull the code from github
-make a production build of the app
-buying a domain from namecheap
-linking the domain name to the VM instance
-bada-bing bada-boom the site works!
